**This solver is out-of-date**

We appreciate any contributions to bring this solver back to life, compare the [issues](https://github.com/precice/6dof-rigid-body-solver/issues).

A simple 6dof rigid body solver adapted to preCICE. This code was originally developed by Bernhard Gatzhammer, called Structure0815, and part of preCICE until version (including) v1.6. [Bernhard's thesis](https://www5.in.tum.de/pub/Gatzhammer2014_preCICE.pdf) gives an introduction to the solver in Section 5.1.6.
